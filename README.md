# Boosting the transferability of adversarial attacks with EOT
This project applies an existed white-box attack method called Expectation over Transformation (EOT) in transfer attacks. The key idea is to introduce a distribution of transformation to the objective function of transfer attacks. Detailed analysis and holistic experiments are conducted to verify the methodology.

See the codes and **Report.pdf** for more detailed information.
